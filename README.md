# sf-dash

This project is for use in my home, on a wall-mounted iPad that's always on. It gives me essential information that I need to know before leaving each morning, and saves the time of pulling out my phone and checking multiple apps.

Planned features are in [TODO.md](TODO.md)

## Build & development

Run `grunt build` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
